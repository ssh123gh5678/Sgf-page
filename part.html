<br> <h2>CPU</h2> </br>

<br><h2>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, is the primary processor in a given computer.[1][2] Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations.[3][4][5] This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry,[6] and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</h2></br>

<br><h2>  MOTHERBOARD </h2> <br>
<br><h2> A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, MB, mobo, base board, system board, or, in Apple computers, logic board) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use </h2> </br>

<br><h2> RAM </h2> </br>



<br> <h2>Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.[1][2] A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks and magnetic tape), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.</h2> </br>

<br> <h2> HARD DISK DRIVES </h2> </br>

<br><h2>A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk[a] is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.[1] Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off.[2][3][4] Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box.</h2></br>
